Total Sales:Total Sales =
SUMX (
    SalesOrderDetail,
    SalesOrderDetail[OrderQty] * SalesOrderDetail[UnitPrice]
        * ( 1 - SalesOrderDetail[UnitPriceDiscount] )
)
This measure calculates the total sales amount by iterating through each row in the SalesOrderDetail table and multiplying the quantity by the unit price (adjusted for any discounts).

Sales Amount by Product Category:

Sales by Category =
SUMX (
    RELATEDTABLE ( SalesOrderDetail ),
    SalesOrderDetail[OrderQty] * SalesOrderDetail[UnitPrice]
        * ( 1 - SalesOrderDetail[UnitPriceDiscount] )
)
To use this, you'd typically have a Product table related to SalesOrderDetail.This measure calculates sales, but it would be used in a Power BI visual (like a bar chart) where you've grouped the data by product category.  Power BI's filter context will make it work.

Customer Sales:

Customer Sales =
CALCULATE (
    [Total Sales],
    FILTER (
        Customer,
        Customer[CustomerID] = SELECTEDVALUE ( Customer[CustomerID] )
    )
)
This calculates the total sales for the selected customer.  SELECTEDVALUE is important to get the CustomerID from the current filter context in a visual.

Year-to-Date Sales:

YTD Sales =
TOTALYTD (
    [Total Sales],
    SalesOrderHeader[OrderDate],
    "30/6"  // Assuming fiscal year ends on June 30th
)
This calculates the year-to-date sales, using the OrderDate from the SalesOrderHeader table.The "30/6" argument specifies June 30th as the fiscal year end.

Previous Year Sales:

Previous Year Sales =
CALCULATE (
    [Total Sales],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR ( SalesOrderHeader[OrderDate] )
)
Calculates the sales for the same period in the previous year.Sales Growth:Sales Growth =
IF (
    NOT ISBLANK ( [Previous Year Sales] ),
    ( [Total Sales] - [Previous Year Sales] ) / [Previous Year Sales],
    0
)
Calculates the growth in sales compared to the previous year.
